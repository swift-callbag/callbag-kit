> [Operators][Operators] that preform mathematical calculation on the entire sequence of items emitted by a source.

- [**Average**][Average]: calculates the average of numbers emitted by a source and emits this average.

- [**Count**][Count]: count the number of items emitted by the source and emit only this value.

- [**Max**][Max]: determine, and emit, the maximum-valued item emitted by a source.

- [**Min**][Min]: determine, and emit, the minimum-valued item emitted by a source.

- [**Sum**][Sum]: calculate the sum of numbers emitted by a source and emit this sum.
